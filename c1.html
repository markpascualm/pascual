<h4>Bachelor of arts</h4>
<p>
	The BA Economics program is designed to prepare students for jobs
	that require research and analytical skills in the public or corporate sector
	and to provide an adequate and reliable intellectual platform for those
	who would like to pursue advanced graduate degrees in economics,
	as well as further studies in law, management, finance, international relations,
	and other related fields. The program incorporates observed trends in
	economics education, aligns teaching methodologies to specific learning philosophies, and promotes research competencies required by 21st-century learners.
 	<br><br>
	The program is designed to equip students with knowledge in economic theory and its application and with essential skills for undertaking economic analysis. Intended to provide students with a more liberal education, the BA program requires fewer major (Economics) courses but more liberal arts, such as those in humanities, other social sciences, and foreign languages. The BA curriculum is more flexible, giving students leeway to customize their program of study according to their personal goals and interests.
